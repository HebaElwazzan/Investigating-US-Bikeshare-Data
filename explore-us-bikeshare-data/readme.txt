>> I used stack overflow to search for some common solutions to some parts
>> I used some reference sites such as w3 schools geeksforgeeks and others
>> I also relied on the pandas and datetime documentation
>> For load_data() function I mostly used the one I wrote in practice problem 3 (it is
very similar to the solution provided) with just a few changes
